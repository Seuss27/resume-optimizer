# Next steps

**Now:** Sprint S02, "Foundation and de-risk" (milestone 2), `implementing`. Task #39 (plan task
B6, the `claude -p` runtime spike) has a spec comment and is anchored.

**Just done:**
- The maintainer ran the live B6 measurements. Item 4 failed on `CLAUDE.md` only, so reviewer
  `support` mode moves to `--bare` with an API key (`RO-D17`). Every other role stays on the
  subscription. Item 1 passed on the reading that built-in plugins, agents and the default style
  are allowed.
- Wrote `docs/spikes/b6-claude-code-runtime.md`, `RO-D17` and the plan §3.6 and §3.7 edits.
  - Its critic pass (`architect`, `security-critic`, `docs-consistency`) converged in 3 rounds.

**Next:** merge the #39 PR (the maintainer's call), then pick the next S02 task. Assigned model:
**sonnet** (coder).

**HITL Gate: NONE OPEN** — next gate: the maintainer merges the #39 PR

**Open for the owner (non-blocking):**
- After `RO-D17`, the plan header's "`RO-D1`..`RO-D16`" range and §3.8's subscription sentence are
  stale for `support` mode (the spec kept them unchanged). D1's spec should pick up three things:
  re-run B6 items 1, 4, 7 and 9 under `--bare`, pass the API key only to the `support` child, and
  create run directories under a parent only the user can write to.
- Still open from #100: a manual run of the `ruleset-drift` workflow, and its last two done-whens (a
  green run, and that a PR with a red `secrets / scan` cannot be merged).
- The Sheet CSV export in #34 (on S03), which blocks C3.
- The `depends_on` markers on #52, #53, #54 (S06) and #55 (S07) name issues in other milestones, so
  `plan-depends.sh` reads each as waiting on every earlier item. Worth its own backlog issue.
- Decide whether to delete or salvage the local branch `docs/sync-cursor-s02-b2-spec`. Its tip has
  commits that no merged PR carries.
- The ruff version is pinned twice, in `pyproject.toml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  Dependabot bumps each through a different ecosystem (#110), so a ruff bump arrives as two PRs:
  merge them together. A check that compares the pins is a possible follow-up. Check the first
  `pre-commit` Dependabot PR's title against `pr-title`'s length cap.
- A decision entry in `docs/decisions.md` for the Betterleaks switch is optional.
- The org's consumer-workflow lint (`check-consumer-workflows.sh`) reports the review gate and the
  devcontainer-image caller missing. The review gate is #88.
- The `secrets / scan` pin stops other apps' statuses, but not a PR that adds or edits a workflow.
  Only the maintainer's merge covers that, and a ruleset `workflows` rule would close it if the F6
  move (#68) makes one available.
- Nothing checks that the `ruleset` and `rulesets` blocks in `.ai/project.yml` agree with each
  other. Worth a backlog issue.
- B4 leaves some output unscrubbed, by design:
  - exception tracebacks
  - third-party text at WARNING and above
  - uncaught-exception stderr output

  The bug template warns about the first two. These tightenings from B4's critic pass were accepted:
  - no symlink check on the log file
  - a half-detached handler pair is not repaired
  - the docstring and template say "WARNING" where the filter passes WARNING and above
- #76 (decide whether the JSON formatter writes extra fields) is answered by B4's allowlist. The
  maintainer can close it or say what is left.

- Raise naming uv in the claude-workbench Python conventions, so the glunk-works repos follow
  (T01's milestone description says this is outside this repo). Place
  glunk-works/claude-workbench#1349 in that repo's milestones.
- If `secrets / scan` fails with `couldn't find remote ref refs/pull/<N>/head`, the cause is
  GitHub, not a secret. GitHub created only the merge ref, and a re-run fails the same way.
  Pushing a commit to the branch creates the head ref (PR #107).
